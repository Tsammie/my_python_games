# Scenario: You want to create a bank account that supports deposits and withdrawals.

# Task: Create a bank account class that has two attributes:

# owner
# balance

# and two methods:
# deposit
# Withdraw

# Withdrawals may not exceed the available balance.
# Instantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account 
# can't be overdrawn.

# You are not expected to use the input function, just pass in values for the amounts into 
# the methods directly, no need for loops either.

# See the next slide for a sample execution of the code you will write.

class Account: 
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
    def deposit (self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print("Deposit Accepted")
        else:
            print("Incorrect Amount")
    

    def withdraw (self, amount):
        if amount < self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print("Withdrawal Accepted")
        else:
            print("Insufficent Balance")
        

    

#1. Instantiate the class
acct1 = Account('Winnie', 100)

#2. Print the object
print(acct1)
# Output:
# Account owner: Winnie
# Account balance: $100

#3. Show the account owner attribute
print(acct1.owner)  # Winnie

#4. Show the account balance attribute 
print(acct1.balance)  # 100

# #5. Make a series of deposits and withdrawals 
acct1.deposit(50)  # Output: Deposit Accepted

acct1.withdraw(15)  # Output: Withdrawal Accepted

print(acct1.balance)
# #6. Make a withdrawal that exceeds the available balance 
# acct1.withdraw(500)  # Output: Funds Unavailable!
